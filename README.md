# DataRx.A2ZDB
The DataRx.A2ZDB project contains databases, SQL Scripts, Diagrams and Documentation regarding the A2Z Object Model.

## DataRx.SDK Progress Briefing
Currently, DataRx.A2ZDB is in an alpha development stage designing and implementing object model prototypes to facilitate engineering storage locations for Arizona taxonomies with metadata support. 

This project is active and is being worked on everyday. I am not yet ready for collaboration but when I am, I am certainly going to reach out for help.
