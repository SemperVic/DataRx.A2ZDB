            <h3>A2ZDB Object Modeling Principles</h3>
            <p>The A2Z object model is first and foremost designed for an enterprise perspective that can be described as 
            a holistic top-down logical model commonly refered to as <i>Entity Attribute Value</i> or EAV model. What this 
            means is the model is created with a different, perhaps more abstract approach than one would likely encounter 
            with a traditional <i>View Integration Model</i>. As a result, it allows you to sustain and build upon your 
            domain taxonomy from a holistic perspective that will provide maximum scalability and effeciency into your 
            problem domain through natural software accreation and data federation.</p>

            <p>The benefit of using this top-down approach is how well the model itself flexes toward your domain of interest without 
            the need for refactoring callstacks into data storage mediums because a column, table, property or new document was added 
            or changed. We have all experienced this problem one time or another. The reason this benefit can be realized is because 
            the physical objects and attributes that transport the data do not describe the data the same way one might find in 
            traditional <i>View Integration Models</i>. 
            
            <p>The following example illustrates this EAV principle at it's core.</p>

                        <li>Everything is an "ENTITY"</li>
                        <li>All "ENTITY" data has an "ENTITY_TYPE"</li>
                        <li>An "ENTITY" can have a "RELATIONSHIP" with another "ENTITY"</li>
                        <li>All "RELATIONSHIPS" have a "RELATIONSHIP_TYPE"</li>
                        <li>An "ENTITY" can have one or more "ATTRIBUTES"</li>
                        <li>An "ATTRIBUTE" has an "ATTRIBUTE_TYPE"</li>
                        <li>An "ATTRIBUTE" can have one or more "ATTRIBUTE_VALUES"</li>
                    </ul>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The above logical model representation is analogous to space-efficient methods of storing a sparse matrix, where only 
            non-empty values are stored. In an EAV data model, each attribute-value pair is a fact describing an object referred to as 
            an "ENTITY" in the above diagram, and a row in an EAV entity stores a single fact. The benifit of this model is this technique 
            makes it easy to store any sparse matrix or composite object to the model maximizing code reuse. Another benift this technique 
            provides is the ability to identify trending data sets.</p>
            <p>Conversely, this strategy requires you to manage relationships via standardized taxonomy and metadata repositories in-lieu 
            of traditional relational constraints as is the case in a bottom-up model. Lastly, this top-down EAV modeling strategy does 
            have a tendency to inherit an abstract nature to the naming convention and normalization techniques. This, combined with logical 
            relational forms will require developers who are not familiar with these patterns and techniques to make the appropriate mental 
            adjustments in how they interact with A2Z's object persistence. In my experiencee, ramp up time usually requires about two weeks 
            working with the model for entry level software developer's who have some experience with data transactions in the web tier.</p>

            <h3>Characteristics of a View Integration Model</h3>
            <p>A2ZDB is different than a traditional "View Integration Model" or bottom-up relational model in a variety of ways. Most notable 
            is the difference in how entities and attributes are described in relation to other entities as well as the data these entities contain.</p>

                        <li>Traditionally, the model's Tables and Columns describe themselves </li>
                        <li>This same pattern exists with dimensional documents and properties. At this stage, 
                        technology and storage platform is irrelavant.</li>
                        <li>View models are traditionally highly constrained in favor of project requirements 
                        and application features. As a result, it can be a 
                        real challenge trying to maintain parity with an enterprise vision.</li>
                        <li>View models are susceptible to disparity due to re-engineering efforts and 
                        personnel change-over.</li>
                        <li>Change management can have a cascading effect on API call stacks as well as user 
                        interface &amp; experience. This is commonly seen when the effort to integrate a 
                        feature is greater than the feature being integrated.</li>

            <h3>Consolidated EAV View Integration Model.</h3>
            <p>In looking at the two model's illustrated above. Theoretically, One could store the information from the View Integration 
            Model into the top-down EAV model but the process would require an abstract layer of recursion. This is not the sweet spot you 
            want to perform development operations. Obviously this would not only require a lot development cycles, but would be complicated 
            to change. Accordingly, a great deal of effort has gone into striving to find that balance between an EAV semantic model and a 
            view integration model for maximum sustainablity, usability, scalability and performance. This unification between the traditional 
            view model and and holistic enterprise model is what A2ZDB strives to meet through what I refered to as a consolidated EAV 
            view integration model. You will learn more about these concrete models when you review the <a href="#">Core Object Models</a>. 
            Colloquially, this model can loosley be described an object oriented data model in relational form.</p>

            <p>Before continuing any further, It is important to point out a few basic premises regarding object modeling.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>There is no wrong way to model and right way to model per se. If your model returns accurate information, you did it right. 
                If your model returns in-accurate information, this would suggest something was missed and could be very costly in the business 
                decision making processes.</li>
                <li>Varying degrees of EAV modeling does occur in view integration models and these efforts increase the sustainability of project's 
                life span</li>
                <li>Over time, if not properly planned, manged and maintained. A bottom up model can contain a variety of constraints, columns 
                and relationships that get lost in translation as people and process are updated and replaced. These properties are usually 
                ignored by developers for fear of regression.</li>
                <li>Finally, the View Integration Model can be difficult to abondoned due to cultural conditioning, training and past project 
                experiences. In fact, It can be so difficult, that the A2Z modeling principles do not completely abondon the concept.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Sparse Matrix</h5>
            <p>A2ZDB makes maximum use of spatial effeciency and performance when designing a taxonomy schema. Great care is given toward 
            properly identifying the nature of not just the data being stored, but also the relationships within a domain of discourse and 
            how it relates to accompanying taxonomys that have simalar attributes and relational characteristics. The differences between 
            these two methods of modeling is a red pill/blue pill argument. If you are new to modeling or perhaps you are a veteran 
            developer considering new ways to  isolate, partition and manage your enterprise data. The A2ZDB will provide you a tremendous 
            springboard toward accomplishing these efforts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 25px;">
            <h3>Schools of Thought</h3>
            <p>The are two major schools of thought when it comes to the strategies DevOps teams apply to data. Likewise, there are 
            a lot of sub-schools of thought on both sides of the isle. In data architecture parlence, on the one hand there is a camp 
            that believes the object model is king of the hill. How data is actually stored and organized in the database is not a 
            super high priority. Depending on the degree this architecture is implemeted, it has been my experience with this pattern, 
            the relational database is treated like someone might manage there own file system. Heavy drill down dependency 
            is placed on traditional object relational mapping techniques like Entity Framework, JDO or Hibernate API protocols 
            to drill through the aggregate.</p> 
            
            <h5>Object Model is King?</h5>
            <p>In truth, there is actually something to be said with this argument. So much so - many DevOps teams have completely moved 
            off this relational database paradigm all together and is now storing serialized composite objects in a document database. 
            This architecture offers tremendous return on data portability and scalability and completely removes the ORM problem domain 
            altogether. Out of sight, out of mind.  But what about all the advantages the very powerfull relational database has to offer?</p>
            
            <h5>Relational Data Model Is King?</h5>
            <p>In the other camp, the object model is not king of the hill. The object model is simply a way to reflect data in a proper 
            context and should not be soley constrained or driven through non-technical market intrest. While this is certainly a valid 
            argument, it does not address why the relational model is king of the hill. The relational database is a very powerful tool 
            when properly used. The reason this camp even exists is because it has tenure. Just because data architecture is trending in 
            other directions, does not mean the relational database platform is deprecated or somehow going away. Database document 
            platform technologies have along way to go before they can fill the gaps relational models do much better than aggregate 
            models.</p>
            
            <h3>Finding Balance</h3>
            <p>As a profesisonal data modelor, if I could offer you one piece of advice toward expanding your career path it would be this. 
            Don't put a dog in this fight -- because you don't have to pick a side. Both platforms offer tremendous opportunity and scalabity. 
            The are very powerful features both platforms have to offer. It is in this spirit A2ZDB's architecture encourages you to uses 
            both when and where warranted.</p> 

            <h3>History of this Model</h3>
            <p>Decades of effort has made this model quite complete in it's core form. More over, it is my experience 
            once developers learn and undertsand this holistic approach, they prefer developing under EAV based Semantic models over 
            "View Integration Models". The reason for this is because it is faster and easier to develop against and provides greater 
            opportunities for code reuse.</p>
            <p>In addition to the physical characteristics of the model's themselves, decades of effort has gone into defining a scalable metadata 
            taxonomy that describes your valuable data assets.  While this project is new, the defined and developed taxonomy is a mature, vast 
            and growing <i>business computing</i> taxonomy infrastructure. This combined with managed metadata repository dependencies 
            that allows the A2ZDB w/Arizona's architecture to stretch it's legs in both development and production environments.</p>
            <p>What this ultimately means is, refactoring storage structure (adding a table or a new column) for your business data becomes a 
            very rare event in feature driven development. Originally - the A2ZDB consisted of 23 EAV Tables, that was almost 20 years ago. 
            Today, the core database and composite architecture requires less than 50 tables. Less than 100% growth in entities in 20 years 
            says something toward the legitamcy of flexibility this model has to offer. I understand this history is important in your decision 
            making process. For additional historical information <a href="#">Click here</a>

<!--
<p>Truth be told - in my heart, I belong to this camp for a number of reasons. My biggest reason has to do with my unique 
            experience in this field and the incredible mentorship I was offered early in my career from some of the top relational 
            data modelors in the world and they guided me into the light. This mentorship explained the big picture and taught me to 
            unlearn my natural orthadoxy to describe my data with database constraints. Since then, I have been learning, expanding 
            the evolution of the model and successfully applying and improving upon these priniples ever since.</p>
            
            The truth of the matter is, the problem is not with 
            the relational database platform. The problem is the relational model is not designed in an effecient way because the 
            industry lost something very special that previously mitigated these problems from occuring in the past. All the developer had 
            to do was write the proper query or the DBA/DBM would give it to them in the form of a view or stored procedure. If you 
            have more interest in this subject area, I encourage you to read "<i>The Problematic Data Model</i>"</p>
            

            <p>As I see it - the problem started at least 30 years ago. Early in my career there was a common job position or role that 
            database administrators or DBA worked along side called a database modelor or DBM. Over the course of about 10 years this 
            discipline and employment role was phased out and diminished considerably. To fill the gap, software developers took over 
            the role. While I am not implying a software developer makes a lousy data modelor, what I am suggesting is that most software 
            developers do not place as much effort in planning and designing big picture or enterprise class data models as they do compared 
            to what they are programming. This is the developers bread and butter. Relational data modeling in this space is  Since then the 
            quality and planning put into the relational database layer has diminished 
            considerably and explains why the "Object Model Is King" camp removed the bottle neck. In short, the problem is not with the 
            relational database architecture. The problem is feature driven data modeling leads to poor database modeling leads to 
            unstastainability, which leads to performance issues which leads to regression and degradation.

            degrees so long as the data in the model can be properly and accuately marshalled. In the other camp With that said, the design approach for the A2ZDB model.
