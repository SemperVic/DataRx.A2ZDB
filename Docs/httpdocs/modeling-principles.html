            <h3>A2ZDB Object Modeling Principles</h3>
            <p>The A2Z object model is first and foremost designed from an enterprise perspective that can be described as 
            a holistic top-down logical model commonly refered to as <i>Entity Attribute Value</i> or EAV model. What this means is the 
            model is created in a more abstract manner than one would likely see with a traditional <i>View Integration Model</i>. As a 
            result, it allows you to sustain your data taxonomy from a holistic perspective that will provide maximum scalability and 
            effeciency into your problem domain through natural software accreation and data federation.</p>

            <p>The benefit of using this top-down approach is how well the model itself flexes toward your domain of interest without 
            the need for refactoring callstacks into data storage mediums because a column, table, property or new document was added 
            or changed. We have all experienced this problem one time or another. The reason this benefit can be realized is because 
            the physical objects and attributes that transport the data do not describe the data the same way one might find in 
            traditional <i>View Integration Models</i>. 
            
            <p>The following example illustrates this EAV principle at it's core.</p>

                        <li>Everything is an "ENTITY"</li>
                        <li>All "ENTITY" data has an "ENTITY_TYPE"</li>
                        <li>An "ENTITY" can have a "RELATIONSHIP" with another "ENTITY"</li>
                        <li>All "RELATIONSHIPS" have a "RELATIONSHIP_TYPE"</li>
                        <li>An "ENTITY" can have one or more "ATTRIBUTES"</li>
                        <li>An "ATTRIBUTE" has an "ATTRIBUTE_TYPE"</li>
                        <li>An "ATTRIBUTE" can have one or more "ATTRIBUTE_VALUES"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <small style="padding-left: 25px;">Reference: <a href="#">EAV Modeling</a> for a broader understanding and appeal.</small>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The above logical model representation is analogous to space-efficient methods of storing a sparse matrix, where only 
            non-empty values are stored. In an EAV data model, each attribute-value pair is a fact describing an object referred to as 
            an "ENTITY" in the above diagram, and a row in an EAV entity stores a single fact. The benifit of this model is this technique 
            makes it easy to store any sparse matrix or composite object to the model maximizing code reuse. Another benift this technique 
            provides is the ability to identify trending data sets.</p>
            <p>Conversely, this strategy requires you to manage relationships via standardized taxonomy and metadata repositories in-lieu 
            of traditional relational constraints as is the case in a bottom-up model. Ultimately this top-down EAV modeling strategy inherits 
            an abstract nature to the naming convention and normalization techniques. This, combined with logical relational forms compared 
            to a constrained relational object model as typically demonstratred with view integration models.</p>

            <h3>Characteristics of a View Integration Model</h3>
            <p>A2ZDB is different than a traditional "View Integration Model" or bottom-up relational model in a variety of ways. Most notable 
            is the difference in how entities and attributes are described in relation to the data these entities contain.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                    <h4>Bottom-Up Object Model</h4>
                    <img src="./assets/view-integration-model.png" style="width: 100%;" />

                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <h4>View Integration Model</h4>
                    <ul style="margin-top: 25px;">
                        <li>Traditionally, the model's Tables and Columns describe themselves </li>
                        <li>This same pattern exists with dimensional documents and properties. Technology and platform is irrelavant at this stage</li>
                        <li>View models are traditionally highly constrained in favor project requirements and application fetures making it a real challenge to maintain parity with an enterprise vision.</li>
                        <li>Susceptible to disparity due to re-engineering efforts</li>
                        <li>Change management can have a cascading effect on API call stacks as well as user interface &amp; experience. This is commonly seen when the effort to integrate a feature is greater than the feature being integrated.</li>
                        <li>DevOps sustainability can be greatly impacted over a life of your data's storage architecture</li>
                    </ul>

        <div class="container" style="margin-top: 25px;">
            <h3>Finding Balance</h3>
            <p>In looking at the two model's illustrated above. Theoretically, One could store the information from the View Integration 
            Model into the top-down EAV model but the process would require an abstract layer of recursion. This is not the sweet spot you 
            want to perform development operations. Obviously this would not only require a lot development cycles, but would be complicated 
            to change. Accordingly, a great deal of effort has gone into striving to find that balance between an EAV semantic model and a 
            view integration model for maximum sustainablity, usability, scalability and performance. This unification between the traditional 
            view model and and holistic enterprise model is what A2ZDB strives to meet through what is refered to as a consolidated EAV 
            integration model. You will learn more about these concrete models when you learn about the <a href="#">Core Object Models</a></p>

            <p>Before continuing any further, It is important to point out a few basic premises regarding object modeling.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no wrong way to model and right way to model per se. If your model returns accurate information, you did it right. If your model returns in-accurate information, this would suggest something was missed and could be very costly in the business decision making processes.</li>
                <li>Varying degrees of EAV modeling does occur in view integration models and these efforts increase the sustainability of project's life span</li>
                <li>Over time, if not properly planned, manged and maintained. A bottom up model can contain a variety of constraints, columns and relationships that get lost in translation as people and process are updated and replaced. These properties are usually ignored by developers for fear of regression.</li>
                <li>Finally, the <i>View Integration Model</i> pattern can be difficult to abondoned due to conditioning, training and past project experiences. In fact, It can be so difficult, that the A2Z 
                modeling principles do not completely abondon the concept.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>A2ZDB makes maximum use of effeciency and performance when designing a taxonomy namespace. Great care is given toward 
            properly identifying the nature of not just the data being stored, but also the relationships within a domain of discourse 
            this model facilitates and how it matches up to other kinds of data that have simalar attributes and characteristics.</p>

            <p>Ultimately the differences between these two methods of modeling is a red pill/blue pill argument. If you are considering 
            changing the way you isolate, partition and manage your enterprise data. The A2ZDB will provide you a tremendous springboard 
            toward accomplishing your efforts.</p>

            <h3>History of this Model</h3>
            <p>Decades of effort has made this model quite complete in it's core form. More over, it is my experience 
            once developers learn and undertsand this holistic approach, they prefer developing under EAV based Semantic models over 
            "View Integration Models". The reason for this is because it is faster and easier to develop against and provides greater 
            opportunities for code reuse.</p>
            <p>In addition to the physical characteristics of the model's themselves, decades of effort has gone into defining the metadata 
            taxonomy that describes your valuable data assets. While this project is new, the defined and developed taxonomy is a mature, vast 
            and growing <i>business computing</i> semantic and taxonomy infrastructure. This combined with managed metadata repository dependencies 
            that allows the A2ZDB w/Arizona's architecture to stretch it's legs in both development and production environments. What this 
            ultimately means is, refactoring storage structure (adding a table or a new column) for your business data becomes a very rare event 
            in feature driven development. Originally - the A2ZDB consisted of 23 EAV Tables, that was almost 20 years ago. Today, the core 
            database and composite architecture requires less than 50 tables. Less than 100% growth in entities in 20 years says something 
            toward the legitamcy of flexibility this model has to offer. We understand this history is important in your decision making process.
