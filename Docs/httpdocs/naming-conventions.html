            <h3>A2ZDB Model Naming Conventions</h3>
            <p>In software development, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for 
            identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other objects found in source code and documentation. Reasons 
            for using a naming convention include the following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code in collaborative team environments.</li>
                <li>To encourage code review focus on more important issues than syntax, code convention and naming standards.</li>
                <li>To enhance source code appearance (for example, by disallowing overly ambigous or unclear abbreviations)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Unfortunately, the choice of naming conventions can be an enormously controversial issue, with partisans of each 
            holding theirs to be the best and others to be inferior. Colloquially, this can certainly become a matter of dogma. 
            The simple truth is - there is no one best naming conventions, their is simply industry standard. As dogmatic as 
            this discussion can get â€“ it is none the less important to set standards to ensure consistency and predictability. 
            Accordingly, the database naming convention and modeling standards set forth by DataRx are aligned with the conventions 
            of the IDEF1X specification previously discussed.</p>

            <h4>Character Casing</h4>
            <p>The primary purpose of casing of letters is human readability and understanding the context of what they are reading. 
            Common conventions include Title Case, Camel Case and Pascal Case. When it comes to data model naming conventions as it 
            pertains to storage objects, DataRx encourages IDEF standards using all upper case characters when supported. This will 
            clearly differentiate reference between data objects and persistence objects (aka: transfer objects, models, business 
            objects, result set).</p>

            <h4>Multi-Word Identifiers</h4>
            <p>A common recommendation is "<i>Use meaningful identifiers</i>." A single word may not be as meaningful, or specific, 
            as multiple words. Consequently, some naming conventions specify rules for the treatment of "compound" identifiers 
            containing more than one word. As most programming languages do not allow white space in identifiers, a method of 
            delimiting each word is needed (to make it easier for subsequent readers to interpret which characters belong to 
            which word). When modeling data, the delimiter used to delimit a multi-word object name will be the underscore 
            "_". e.g. WORKFLOW_TRANSITION. While it goes without saying - as a rule and general policy, DataRx <u>WILL NOT</u> 
            name data models using Camel or Pascal casing methodologies in raw form. These casing techniques will however; be 
            applied in the transport object at run-time.</p>

            <h4>Entity and Attribute Key Words</h4>
            <p>What many developers recognize as a table is referred to as an Entity in IDEF1X. Likewise, a column is referred to as 
            an Attribute. An Entity is a representation of a class of real or abstract things (people, objects, places, events, ideas, 
            or a combination of things (composite object) that are recognized as instances of the same class because they share the 
            same characteristics and can participate in the same relationships. An Attribute is a property or characteristic that 
            is common to some or all of the instances of an entity. An attribute represents the use of a domain in the context of 
            an entity.</p>

            <h4>Other Important Keywords</h4>
            <p>Understanding the database naming convention requires you to have an understanding of certain keywords that are used to 
            help you as a developer understand not only the purpose of an Entity or Attribute but also identify the functional context 
            of these objects.</p>
            <p><b>Entity Keywords</b></p>
            <p>First and foremost, all entity objects are prefixed with a keyword that describes the domain of the object itself. 
            The purpose of this is to easily identify a collection of entities that are related to one another in any given context 
            called a domain model. While this separation of concern helps understand the object model as a whole. It should be 
            understood that it is natural for relationships to exist between domain models.</p>
