# DataRx.A2ZDB For SQLite 3
The DataRx.A2ZDB project supports the SQLite 3 database. SQLite is a self-contained, in-process library that is serverless, and transactional.

## DataRx.SDK Progress Briefing
Currently, DataRx.A2ZDB is in an alpha development stage designing and implementing object model prototypes to facilitate engineering storage locations for Arizona taxonomies with metadata support. 

This project is active and is being worked on everyday. I am not yet ready for collaboration but when I am, I am certainly going to reach out for help.
